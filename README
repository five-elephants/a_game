A Game!

is a fast strategy game, or at least that is what I want it to be. The current
state is the result of two days of work. You can play against a computer
opponent on a single map. It still needs a lot of balancing and tweaking of
the game experience. If you want to take a shot yourself, take a look at
rules.py. The file defines central gameplay constants that have a huge impact on
the experience.


HOW TO PLAY

You need the python module pygame installed. At the prompt type
$ python a_game.py

You play with the mouse. Yours are the red pieces. Your goal is to remove all
blue pieces (controlled by the computer) from the map. You do this by first
building a network of nodes over the map and then use these to attack the enemy
network.

Creating new nodes:
Click on one of your existing nodes and then on a free position on the map. This
creates a new node that is connected to your old node. Every node has a certain
size value and is either growing or shrinking. This is indicated by the size of
the node and its color. Connections transport a certain amount of this size to 
the other node. This happens at fixed intervals with a fixed quantity.
A new node is initially shrinking (blue state) and must be fed by its parent
until it is growing (orange state) by itself. If a node is shrinking and not fed
from other nodes it will eventually die and be removed from the map.

Attacking nodes:
Click on one of your nodes and then on one of your opponent. This will create a
connection that periodically inflicts damage on the opponent node. It will also 
drain the attacking node.
By the way, connections - attacking or not - may not cross connections of
another player. You can use this to cut the map and create protected areas.
