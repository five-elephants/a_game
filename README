A Game!

is a fast strategy game, or at least that is what I want it to be. The current
state is the result of two days of work. You can play against a computer
opponent on a single map. It still needs a lot of balancing and tweaking of
the game experience. If you want to take a shot yourself, take a look at
rules.py. The file defines central gameplay constants that have a huge impact on
the experience.


HOW TO PLAY

You need the python module pygame installed. At the prompt type
$ python a_game.py

You play with the mouse. Yours are the red pieces. Your goal is to remove all
blue pieces (controlled by the computer) from the map. You do this by first
building a network of nodes over the map and then use these to attack the enemy
network.
